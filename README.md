# Hear.me 

The wearable device developed by HEAR.ME continuously monitor sounds from the environment and provides alerts through vibrations in cases of sudden changes.

Once the technology notifies the user, the information generated by the alerts will be sent in real time from the wearable to the mobile app via Bluetooth.

The user will be able to analyze the notifications through the mobile app or website including information about location, date and time.

We want to provide an inclusive future. A better future.
